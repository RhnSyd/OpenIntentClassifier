This project contains two implementations for Intent Classification. 
The RAG based approach and Graph based approach.

Since both use BERT, re training the model will take a long time, in order to save time, we are giving the weights.pth files for both the models, simply load this file to get the weights of our model, now the test and train accuracy can be calculated again and plotted if needed.


The dataset is downloaded from dataloader in the code, so no csv or excel file is needed.
