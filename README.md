## OpenIntentClassifier
OpenIntentClassifier is a BERT-based model designed to handle open intent classification for a banking chatbot. It distinguishes between in-scope questions related to banking services and out-of-scope queries, ensuring your chatbot can provide accurate and reliable responsesâ€”or gracefully handle queries outside its domain.

Features
Open Intent Classification: Classifies user queries into predefined banking intents or flags them as out of scope.
BERT-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Uses BERT for understanding user queries and generating intent classifications.
Customizable Dataset: Trained using datasets like BANKING77 but adaptable to other datasets for specific use cases.
Out-of-Scope Detection: Provides a safe fallback for questions beyond the scope of the banking chatbot.
